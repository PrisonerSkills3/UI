                        <p>Browse our profiles to find the skills you are looking for. Consider hiring someone who has been convicted of a crime in their past. No one wants their past to define them.</p>

                        <p>Our app is all about second chances. It can be really difficult to find work after prison. We want to provide a place to connect those with a conviction in their past to those who are willing to provide employment opportunities.</p>

                    <p>We currently have over 1,000 profiles on our app from qualified and skilled people who have made a mistake in their past. Some of our profiles are from current inmates while others are back home and on the job hunt. Our app makes it easy to filter down profiles to find the perfect fit.</p>
